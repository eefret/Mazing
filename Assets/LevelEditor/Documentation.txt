How to use
  - To begin you need to create an empty GameObject and then add the Grid Creator script to it.
  - Once you have the script you need to make an initial setup. The parameters in order are:
    - The map index and level index, this will be used for now to make a save file.
    - The map width and height (In grid blocks, dont make this too big or unity could crash/work really slow)
    - Set a floor material (There is one in LevelEditor/Materials that you can use)
    - The Initial Fill value is for when you init a level the value of the blocks will be 0 or 1 (0 is a grid empty space and 1 is a wall)
  - When the script is set up you can do a Init map to create the map initial state and then start editing.

  - The grid creator script in the inspector has a couple of buttons that call some functions.
    - Init map: Create the initial map filled with the value specified in Initial Fill parameter. (When you press the button the label will change to Confirm Init and you need to press the button again)
    - Create map: Creates the tiles in the map, use it once you have finish the edit process to make the map objects.
    - Clear map: Clears all the map objects (Usefull if you dont want them in the way)
    - Start editing: Unlocks the map so you can edit it. Also it displays the edit tools
    - Stop editing: Locks the map so you cant edit it.
    - Save level: Saves the level to a level file (.csv file) use this for safety once you have a level that you are happy with. You can also make a prefab of the object somewhere in the Assets folder for safety too.
    - Auto save: This has a checkbox, if checked the program will save the level every x seconds, the seconds can be changed with the slide bar next to it (5-180 seconds)
    - Load level: Loads the last level in the save folder (This button also needs a confirmation by pressing it again when the label change to Confirm Load).

Editing and editing tools
  - Left mouse button sets a tile value to 0 (Empty) and Right mouse button sets a tile to 1 (Wall)
  - When you start the editing of the level you will see 3 buttons on the top left side of the editor view. The tools are:
    - Simple: Sets the tile to the value of the mouse press. You can drag the mouse to set multiple tiles.
    - Line: Creates a line from the initial point (Mouse pressed) to the end point (Mouse released) with the value of the mouse press.
    - Rect: Makes a rectangle from the initial point (Mouse press) to the end point (Mouse released) with the value of the mouse press.

Important stuff
  - Actualy empty tiles have a quad (Gameobject) in it and wall are empty :P. This is because is cheaper to draw the floors and not the walls.
  - Save files for levels will be stored on Assets/LevelEditor/Saves the name will be automaticaly generated by the Level and Map integer set on the GridCreator script in the editor.
  - You need to set the current level grid creator on the player movement script (Drag and drop level object to the Level parameter of Player Movement script)
